            <div class="card">
                <h3>Do you install foam-capable sprinkler systems?</h3>
                <p>Yes. We design and install systems that can proportion Class A+ foam safely when appropriate. Foam enhances water penetration and extends protection duration, making it particularly valuable for roofline systems during extended wildfire events.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Which counties do you serve?</h3>
                <p>We serve Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa Barbara, Orange, Placer, and El Dorado counties. Special projects outside these areas may be considered depending on scope and location.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Do you provide Home Ignition Zone assessments?</h3>
                <p>Yes. We evaluate immediate (0-5 ft), intermediate (5-30 ft), and extended (30-100 ft) zones with prioritized recommendations based on both impact and cost. Our assessments identify the most critical vulnerabilities first.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">What's the typical cost for a sprinkler system?</h3>
                <p>Costs vary significantly based on property size, water supply, terrain, and system complexity. Residential systems typically range from $15,000-$50,000+. We provide detailed proposals after site visits so you know exactly what you're getting.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">How long does installation take?</h3>
                <p>Most residential sprinkler systems are installed within 2-4 weeks once materials arrive. Design and permitting typically take 1-3 weeks. We'll provide a specific timeline in your proposal.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Do I need a special water supply?</h3>
                <p>Not necessarily. We design systems around your existing water infrastructure - whether that's municipal water, a well, or stored water in tanks. If your current supply is insufficient, we'll recommend appropriate upgrades like tanks or pumps.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Will sprinklers guarantee my home survives a wildfire?</h3>
                <p>No system can guarantee survival in all wildfire scenarios, but properly designed sprinkler systems significantly improve your odds, especially when combined with ember-resistant construction and defensible space. They're one layer in a comprehensive defense strategy.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Can I operate the system myself during a fire?</h3>
                <p>Yes, if conditions allow you to remain on property safely. We design systems with both automatic and manual activation. However, your primary responsibility is always to evacuate when authorities order it. Systems should be pre-activated before evacuation.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Do you offer maintenance services?</h3>
                <p>Yes. We provide annual maintenance contracts that include system inspection, nozzle cleaning, pump testing, and winterization (where applicable). Regular maintenance ensures your system will function when needed.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">What's included in a Home Ignition Zone assessment?</h3>
                <p>A complete HIZ assessment includes on-site evaluation of all three zones, photographic documentation, prioritized mitigation recommendations with cost estimates, vegetation management guidelines, and a written report. Assessments typically take 2-3 hours on site.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Are your systems NFPA compliant?</h3>
                <p>Our designs reference NFPA standards including 1144 (wildland-urban interface protection) and 1141 (fire protection infrastructure). However, residential wildfire defense systems aren't always required to meet commercial fire suppression standards.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Can you help with insurance requirements?</h3>
                <p>Yes. We can document system specifications and HIZ improvements for insurance purposes. Some insurers offer premium reductions for wildfire mitigation measures - we'll provide the documentation you need.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Do you work with existing contractors and landscapers?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely. We frequently coordinate with general contractors, landscapers, and other trades. We can integrate our systems into larger renovation or new construction projects.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">What if I'm not sure what I need?</h3>
                <p>That's exactly why we start with a consultation and site visit. We'll assess your property's specific risks and constraints, explain your options, and recommend a practical approach that fits your budget and protection goals.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">How do foam concentrates work?</h3>
                <p>Class A foams reduce water surface tension, allowing deeper penetration into fuels. This creates longer-lasting protective barriers compared to water alone. We stock environmentally responsible foam products and can deliver bulk quantities.</p>
                
                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Can I buy equipment from you without installation?</h3>
                <p>Yes! Visit our <a href="shop.html">shop page</a> to browse fire pumps, hoses, nozzles, foam concentrates, and accessories. We're happy to provide technical guidance on equipment selection even if you're self-installing.</p>
